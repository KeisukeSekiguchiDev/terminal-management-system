## Key Points

### Why Django?
1. **Auto-generated admin panel** - No need to build from scratch
2. **Easy to learn** - Basic mastery in 2 weeks
3. **Rich features** - Authentication, DB, security included

### Why This Order?
1. Build server side first (data receiver)
2. Then agent (data sender)
3. Finally add detailed features
